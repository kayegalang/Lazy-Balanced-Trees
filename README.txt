Description: This project challenges you to implement a basic database system using a specialized type of binary search tree, known as a Lazily Balanced Binary Search Tree (LB-BST). Though it won't be as advanced as commercial databases like Oracle or MySQL, your program will allow users to perform essential operations such as inserting, deleting, and querying data.

The database will store information typical of a university system, including student and faculty records. Each type of record will be stored in its own binary search tree (or "table" in database terminology). You will implement a templated version of the LB-BST, a self-balancing tree that automatically rebuilds itself when the height difference between its subtrees exceeds a specified threshold. This ensures that the tree remains efficient for operations.
